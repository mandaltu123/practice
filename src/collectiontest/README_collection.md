A collection — sometimes called a container — is simply an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit.
Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data. Typically, they represent data
items that form a natural group, such as a poker hand (a collection of cards), a mail folder (a collection of letters),
or a telephone directory (a mapping of names to phone numbers). If you have used the Java programming language — or just
about any other programming language — you are already familiar with collections.
