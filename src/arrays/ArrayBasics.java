/**
 * An array is collection of items stored at continuous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of same
 * type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base
 * value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

 For simplicity, we can think of an array a fleet of stairs where on each step is placed a value (letâ€™s say one of your
 friends). Here, you can identify the location of any of your friends by simply knowing the count of the step they are
 on.
